# pybgrick
mildly camoflauged rickroll that 

   a) hides itself in the background, and <br>
   b) puts itself in startup folder

the links needed by the code are encrypted with the most basic of ciphers possible, the point is to add a minor roadblock to mildly discourage somebody from just copy pasting the link in their browser. not sure what exactly that accomplished, since its a .exe in the end...
